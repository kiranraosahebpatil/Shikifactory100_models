# Shikifactory100_models
Updated yeast and E coli models with allosteric regulation
Based on genome-scale metabolic models iML1515 (e. coli) and iMM904 (yeast).

The allosteric interactions are encoded in SBML at reaction level with ModifierSpeciesReference and the respective SBO Term, SBO:0000020 (inhibition) or SBO:0000459 (activation).
